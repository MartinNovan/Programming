# README for Console Application

## Overview

This Console Application demonstrates the use of various data types in C#. It showcases how to store and manipulate different types of data, including integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, characters, and strings.

## How It Works

### Data Types

1. **Storing Positive Integers**:
   - The program initializes and displays values of various unsigned integer types: `byte`, `ushort`, `uint`, and `ulong`.

2. **Storing Signed Integers**:
   - It demonstrates the use of signed integer types: `short`, `int`, and `long`, displaying their maximum values.

3. **Storing Floating-Point Numbers**:
   - The program initializes and displays values of different floating-point types: `float`, `double`, and `decimal`.

4. **Boolean Data Type**:
   - A boolean variable is initialized and its value is printed based on a simple conditional check.

5. **Text Data Types**:
   - The program demonstrates the use of `char` and `string`. It shows how to replace characters in a string and prints the modified string.

### User Interaction

- The program prompts the user to enter their name and displays it back to them.

## Conclusion

This Console Application serves as a practical example of how to work with different data types in C#. It provides a basic understanding of how to store, manipulate, and display various types of data, making it a useful tool for learning C# programming concepts.
