# Data Compression and Encoding

## Introduction
This assignment focuses on data compression and encoding techniques. The provided Python scripts demonstrate different methods for processing and analyzing data files. The goal is to understand how data can be compressed and encoded efficiently.

## File Examples
The following example files are provided for testing and analysis:

- `example_1.txt`: Contains a small dataset for basic testing.
- `example_2.txt`: Contains a slightly larger dataset for intermediate testing.
- `example_3.txt`: Contains a larger dataset for advanced testing.
- `example_4.txt`: Contains a very large dataset for stress testing.
- `example_5.txt`: Contains a mixed dataset for varied testing.

## Message Files
The following message files are provided for encoding and decoding exercises:

- `message_1.txt`: Contains a simple message for basic encoding.
- `message_2.txt`: Contains a more complex message for intermediate encoding.
- `message_3.txt`: Contains a long message for advanced encoding.

## Python Scripts
The following Python scripts are provided for processing the data:

### `script1.py`
This script processes a file line by line and checks if a code can be made based on the inequality condition. It uses the formula \( \text{inequality} = \sum 2^{-n} \), where \( n \) is the value of each line in the file.

**Usage:**
```bash
python script1.py <path_to_file>
```

### `script2.py`
This script processes a file line by line and counts the occurrences of each alphabetical character. It then prints the character counts in sorted order.

**Usage:**
```bash
python script2.py <path_to_file>
```

### `script3.py`
This script is similar to `script1.py` but also generates an example of a code that can be made if the inequality condition is satisfied.

**Usage:**
```bash
python script3.py <path_to_file>
```

## Assignment Tasks
1. **Data Analysis**: Use the provided scripts to analyze the example files and understand the data patterns.
2. **Encoding**: Implement additional encoding techniques to compress the data in the message files.
3. **Optimization**: Optimize the provided scripts for better performance and efficiency.
4. **Testing**: Test the scripts with different datasets and analyze the results.
