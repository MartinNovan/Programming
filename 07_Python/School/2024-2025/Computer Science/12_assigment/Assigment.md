Take the code from today's lesson (for those missing, I am attaching it) and create a Python project with the same structure as `example.zip`.

In the `tests` folder, write pytest tests for the given code.

Using the `pytest-cov` library, verify that your tests have 100% code coverage.

Submit a zip archive containing the following folders:
./tests
./program

Don't forget the `__init__.py` files.

You can run the tests using:
pytest --cov=calc tests/
