# Python Classwork Example

This project contains a simple Python script that demonstrates basic programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, list operations, and functions. The script is designed to be a practical exercise for students learning Python.

### Key Concepts

- **Variables**: The script uses variables to store and manipulate data. For example, `random` is an integer variable used in conditional and loop statements.

- **Conditional Statements**: The `if` statement checks if `random` is less than 600 and prints it if true.

- **Loops**: A `for` loop iterates from the value of `random` to 599, printing each number.

- **List Operations**: The script demonstrates basic list operations such as `pop`, `append`, and element assignment.

- **Functions**: The `main` function prompts the user for their name and prints a welcome message. This demonstrates how to define and call functions in Python.

## Conclusion

This script provides a hands-on example of basic Python programming concepts, making it a useful resource for students learning the language. By working through this example, students can gain a better understanding of how to use variables, conditionals, loops, lists, and functions in Python.
