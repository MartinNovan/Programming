# Keeping Functions Short and Simple in Python

This project demonstrates how to simplify complex functions in Python by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. This approach improves readability, maintainability, and reduces the cognitive load on developers.

## 5_1.py: Analyze Data

- **Old Code**: Nested conditions and loops made the function complex.
- **New Code**: Simplified logic by using a single loop and conditional expression.
- **Reason**: Reduces nesting and makes the function easier to understand.

## 5_2.py: Process Transactions

- **Old Code**: Nested conditions for different transaction types.
- **New Code**: Separated logic into `process_credit` and `process_debit` functions.
- **Reason**: Each function now handles a specific type of transaction, improving clarity.

## 5_3.py: Evaluate Condition

- **Old Code**: Deeply nested conditions for evaluating `a`.
- **New Code**: Split logic into `evaluate_positive` function.
- **Reason**: Simplifies the main function and makes the logic for positive numbers reusable.

## 5_4.py: Navigate Maze

- **Old Code**: Triple nested loops with complex logic.
- **New Code**: Extracted cell processing into `process_cell` function.
- **Reason**: Reduces complexity of the main loop and makes cell processing logic reusable.

By following these practices, the code becomes more modular and easier to maintain, reducing the risk of errors and improving code quality.
