# Old code
# Check if the user is over 18
# if user.age > 18:
#     # User is over 18, grant access
#     grant_access()
# else:
#     # User is under 18, deny access
#     deny_access()

# New code with improved comments
# Determine access based on user's age
if user.age > 18:
    # Grant access if user is over 18
    grant_access()
else:
    # Deny access if user is under 18
