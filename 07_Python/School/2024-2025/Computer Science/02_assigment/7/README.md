# Consistent Code Formatting in Python

This project demonstrates the importance of consistent code formatting in Python. Consistent formatting improves readability and reduces errors, making code easier to maintain and collaborate on.

## 7_1.py: Calculate Average

- **Old Code**: Inconsistent spacing around operators and between elements.
- **New Code**: Added consistent spacing around operators and between list elements.
- **Reason**: Improves readability and follows PEP 8 guidelines.

## 7_2.py: Product Availability

- **Old Code**: Inconsistent indentation and spacing.
- **New Code**: Ensured consistent indentation and spacing.
- **Reason**: Enhances readability and maintains a uniform style.

## 7_3.py: Employee List

- **Old Code**: Inconsistent spacing in list and string concatenation.
- **New Code**: Added consistent spacing in list and string concatenation.
- **Reason**: Makes the code easier to read and understand.

## 7_4.py: Division Function

- **Old Code**: Inconsistent spacing around operators and function calls.
- **New Code**: Added consistent spacing around operators and function calls.
- **Reason**: Follows PEP 8 guidelines and improves code clarity.

By following these practices, the code becomes more professional and easier to work with, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving collaboration.
