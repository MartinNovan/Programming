# README for Complex Number Calculator

## Overview

This Complex Number Calculator is a console-based application that allows users to perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers. Users can input two complex numbers and calculate their sum, difference, product, and quotient. The application demonstrates the use of classes and methods in C#.

## How It Works

### Main Functionality

1. **User Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to enter the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers. It reads these inputs from the console.

2. **Complex Number Class**:
   - The `ComplexNumber` class encapsulates the properties and methods for complex number arithmetic. It has:
     - **Constructor**: Initializes the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
     - **Addition**: The `Add` method takes another `ComplexNumber` as an argument and returns a new `ComplexNumber` that is the sum of the two.
     - **Subtraction**: The `Subtract` method returns a new `ComplexNumber` that is the difference between the two complex numbers.
     - **Multiplication**: The `Multiply` method returns a new `ComplexNumber` that is the product of the two complex numbers.
     - **Division**: The `Divide` method returns a new `ComplexNumber` that is the quotient of the two complex numbers, handling division by zero appropriately.
     - **String Representation**: The `ToString` method provides a string representation of the complex number in the format "a + bi" or "a - bi".

3. **Calculating Results**:
   - After creating two `ComplexNumber` instances from user input, the program calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two complex numbers using the respective methods.

4. **Output**:
   - The results of the calculations are displayed to the user in a readable format.

## Conclusion

This Complex Number Calculator serves as a practical example of how to implement arithmetic operations for complex numbers in a console application using C#. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as class design, method implementation, and user input handling. Users can easily perform calculations with complex numbers, making it a useful tool for mathematical tasks involving complex arithmetic.
