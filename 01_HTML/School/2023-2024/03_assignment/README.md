# HTML Assignment 3: Form Handling and Data Submission

Building on the knowledge from Assignment 1 and 2, in this assignment, you learned how to create a form in HTML and handle data submission. Key concepts covered include:

- **Forms**: Understanding how to create forms using the `<form>` tag, including various input types such as text, password, number, email, checkbox, and select dropdowns.
- **Input Validation**: Using attributes like `required`, `max`, and `min` to ensure that users provide valid input.
- **Data Submission**: How to submit form data to another page (in this case, `data.html`) using the `action` attribute of the form.
- **Displaying Submitted Data**: Using JavaScript to retrieve and display the submitted data on the `data.html` page by parsing the URL parameters.

This assignment built upon the previous knowledge of HTML and styles, introducing you to interactive elements and data handling, which are essential skills in web development.
