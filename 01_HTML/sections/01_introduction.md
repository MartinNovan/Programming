# Introduction to HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It structures content on the web by using tags to define different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

### What is HTML?
HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It tells the web browser how to display content using various tags and attributes.

### Why is HTML important?
HTML is the foundation of web development. Every website, regardless of its complexity, is built on HTML. Understanding HTML is essential for creating and designing web pages.

### How does HTML work?
HTML works by using elements (tags) to define different types of content on a webpage. These elements can be nested inside each other to create a structured document.

### Tools for Writing HTML
To start writing HTML, you can use a variety of text editors or integrated development environments (IDEs). Here are some popular options:

- **Notepad (Windows)**: A simple text editor available on Windows. Itâ€™s basic but works for writing HTML code.
- **TextEdit (Mac)**: A default text editor for macOS. Make sure to use it in plain text mode to avoid unnecessary formatting.
- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: A free, powerful code editor with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and extensions specifically for web development.
- **Sublime Text**: Another popular code editor, known for its speed and ease of use.
- **Atom**: A free, open-source text editor with built-in Git control and a great selection of community-driven packages.
- **Brackets**: A lightweight code editor with live preview functionality, making it ideal for web development.
- **WebStorm**: A more advanced IDE by JetBrains, ideal for larger web development projects.

You can write HTML code in any text editor, but using a code editor with syntax highlighting can make it much easier to read and understand your code.
