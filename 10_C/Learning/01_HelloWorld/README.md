# Hello World in C

## Introduction
This is the first project in the C programming language, demonstrating the basic structure of a C program. The program simply prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Code Explanation

### `main.c`
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

- **`#include <stdio.h>`**: This line includes the standard input-output library, which provides functions like `printf` for printing to the console.
- **`int main()`**: The `main` function is the entry point of any C program. It returns an integer value, typically `0` to indicate successful execution.
- **`printf("Hello, World!\n");`**: This line prints the string "Hello, World!" followed by a newline character (`\n`) to the console.
- **`return 0;`**: This line indicates that the program has executed successfully.

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C compiler, e.g. .
2. Run the compiled program.
