# C Learning Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains a series of learning projects designed to help beginners understand the fundamentals of the C programming language. Each project focuses on a specific concept, providing hands-on experience through practical examples.

## Project Structure
The projects are organized into the `Learning` directory, with each subdirectory containing a specific topic. Each topic includes a `main.c` file for implementation, a `CMakeLists.txt` file for building the project, and a README file that explains the concept in detail.

### Learning Projects

1. **01_HelloWorld**
   - **Description**: This project serves as an introduction to the C programming language. It demonstrates the basic structure of a C program, including the `main` function and the use of the `printf` function to output text to the console.
   - **Files**:
     - `main.c`: Contains the implementation of the "Hello World" program.
     - `CMakeLists.txt`: Configuration file for building the project.
     - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the project.

2. **02_Variables**
   - **Description**: This project explains the concept of variables in C. It covers different data types, how to declare and initialize variables, and how to use them in expressions. The project includes examples of variable usage in the `main.c` file.
   - **Files**:
     - `main.c`: Demonstrates variable declaration and usage.
     - `CMakeLists.txt`: Configuration file for building the project.
     - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the project.

3. **03_Operators**
   - **Description**: This project details the various operators available in C, including arithmetic, relational, and logical operators. It provides examples of how to use these operators in expressions and control flow within the `main.c` file.
   - **Files**:
     - `main.c`: Contains examples of operator usage.
     - `CMakeLists.txt`: Configuration file for building the project.
     - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the project.

4. **04_If**
   - **Description**: This project focuses on conditional statements in C, specifically the `if`, `else if`, and `else` constructs. It explains how to control the flow of a program based on conditions and includes examples in the `main.c` file.
   - **Files**:
     - `main.c`: Demonstrates the use of conditional statements.
     - `CMakeLists.txt`: Configuration file for building the project.
     - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the project.

5. **05_Loops**
   - **Description**: This project covers looping constructs in C, including `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. It explains how to repeat actions and includes examples demonstrating the use of loops in the `main.c` file.
   - **Files**:
     - `main.c`: Contains examples of different loop constructs.
     - `CMakeLists.txt`: Configuration file for building the project.
     - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the project.

6. **06_Strings**
   - **Description**: This project introduces strings in C, explaining how to work with character arrays and string manipulation functions. It provides examples of string handling in the `main.c` file.
   - **Files**:
     - `main.c`: Demonstrates string manipulation techniques.
     - `CMakeLists.txt`: Configuration file for building the project.
     - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the project.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the individual projects, navigate to the respective project directory and use the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./<executable_name>
```

Replace `<executable_name>` with the name of the compiled output file.

## Conclusion
These projects provide a comprehensive introduction to the C programming language, covering essential concepts that are foundational for further learning and development. Each project is designed to be simple yet effective in demonstrating key programming principles.
