# JavaScript Test Result Formatter

This script processes test results and formats them into HTML list items. It demonstrates the use of JavaScript's array methods and template literals to create a dynamic list of items.

## Functionality

The script defines an object `result` containing arrays of strings that represent different categories of test results:

- `success`: An array of successful test identifiers.
- `failure`: An array of failed test identifiers.
- `skipped`: An array of skipped test identifiers.

The main function, `makeList`, is responsible for converting an array of test identifiers into an array of HTML list items.

### `makeList` Function

- **Parameters**: 
  - `arr`: An array of strings representing test identifiers.

- **Process**:
  - Uses the `map` method to iterate over each item in the `arr` array.
  - For each item, it creates a string representing an HTML list item (`<li>`) with a class of "text-warning".
  - The resulting array of list items is logged to the console and returned by the function.

### Example Usage

The script includes an example call to the `makeList` function:


```javascript
const failuresList = makeList(result.failure);
```

This example processes the `failure` array from the `result` object and formats each item as an HTML list item. The formatted list is stored in the `failuresList` variable and logged to the console.

## Notes

- The script uses ES6 features such as arrow functions and template literals for concise and readable code.
- The `makeList` function is flexible and can be used to format any array of strings into HTML list items.
- The `console.log` statement is used to display the formatted list in the console for verification.
