# Old code
# Loop through the list of numbers
# for i in range(len(numbers)):
#     # Get the current number
#     num = numbers[i]
#     # Print the number
#     print("Number:", num)

# New code with improved comments
# Iterate over each number in the list
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    # Retrieve and print the current number
    num = numbers[i]
    print("Number:", num)
