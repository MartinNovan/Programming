# Commenting Code in Python

This project demonstrates the importance of writing meaningful comments in Python code. Comments should explain the purpose of the code, not how it works, making it easier for others to understand the intent behind the code.

## 2_1.py: Multiply Function

- **Old Comment**: "This function multiplies two numbers"
- **New Comment**: "Return the product of a and b"
- **Reason**: The new comment clarifies the function's purpose, focusing on the result rather than the process.

## 2_2.py: User Age Check

- **Old Comment**: "Check if the user is over 18"
- **New Comment**: "Determine access based on user's age"
- **Reason**: The new comment explains the purpose of the condition, which is to determine access rights.

## 2_3.py: Loop Through Numbers

- **Old Comment**: "Loop through the list of numbers"
- **New Comment**: "Iterate over each number in the list"
- **Reason**: The new comment provides a clearer explanation of the loop's purpose, emphasizing iteration over the list.

## 2_4.py: Configure Window

- **Old Comment**: "Set the background color to green"
- **New Comment**: "Configure window background to indicate success"
- **Reason**: The new comment explains the reason for the color change, which is to indicate a successful operation.

By following these commenting principles, the code becomes more understandable and maintainable, allowing developers to quickly grasp the purpose of each section.
