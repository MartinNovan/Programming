# Meaningful Naming in Python

This project demonstrates the importance of using meaningful names in Python code. By using descriptive names, code becomes more readable and maintainable, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and modify.

## 1_1.py: Calculate Hypotenuse

- **Old Function Name**: `c`
- **New Function Name**: `calculate_hypotenuse`
- **Reason**: The new name clearly indicates that the function calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle given two sides.

## 1_2.py: Print Array

- **Old Variable Name**: `arr`
- **New Variable Name**: `numbers`
- **Old Function Name**: `p`
- **New Function Name**: `print_array`
- **Reason**: The new names describe the purpose of the variable and function, making it clear that the function prints the elements of an array.

## 1_3.py: Person Class

- **Old Class Name**: `P`
- **New Class Name**: `Person`
- **Old Method Name**: `d`
- **New Method Name**: `display`
- **Reason**: The new names provide clarity about the class representing a person and the method displaying the person's details.

## 1_4.py: Calculate Circle Properties

- **Old Function Name**: `s`
- **New Function Name**: `calculate_circle_properties`
- **Reason**: The new name indicates that the function calculates properties of a circle, such as area and circumference, given the radius.

By following these naming conventions, the code becomes more intuitive and easier to follow, reducing the cognitive load on developers and improving collaboration.
