# Documentation for `text_stats.py` Tests

## Introduction

This documentation describes white box tests performed on the `text_stats.py` application, which performs various text operations and includes a division function. The tests were implemented using the `pytest` framework.

## Types of Tests

### 1. Text Length Testing (function `length`)

Tests verifying correct counting of input text length.

- **Tests:**
  - `test_length_short`: Tests common short texts
  - `test_length_no_text`: Tests empty string
  - `test_length_long`: Tests very long texts with repetition

### 2. Number Division Testing (function `divide`)

Comprehensive tests for mathematical division operation.

- **Tests:**
  - `test_divide`: Tests basic integer division
  - `test_divide_by_noint`: Tests division with decimal results
  - `test_divide_negative`: Tests division with negative numbers
  - `test_divide_zero`: Tests handling of division by zero

## Code Coverage

Tests cover the main functional parts of the application:
- Processing text strings of various lengths
- Mathematical operations with different types of numbers
- Handling edge cases (empty string, division by zero)

## Test Results

- **Total number of tests:** 7
- **Successful tests:** 7
- **Failed tests:** 0

### Interesting Findings:
- The original implementation of the `length` function contained a modulo 1000 limitation which was removed for proper functionality
- The `divide` function correctly raises an exception when dividing by zero
- Tests confirmed correct behavior when working with very long strings

## White Box Testing Techniques Used

1. **Statement Coverage** - tests cover all lines of code
2. **Branch Coverage** - testing different condition branches (e.g., division by zero)
3. **Path Coverage** - testing different code paths
4. **Boundary Testing** - testing boundary values (empty string, zero in division)

## Conclusion

White box tests proved the robustness of the implementation and revealed an original error in the `length` function implementation. After fixing, all tests pass successfully.
